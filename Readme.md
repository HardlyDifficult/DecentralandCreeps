# Decentraland Tower Defense Game

This is a simple tower defense game for Decentraland.

The game generates a random path and places traps in random locations along that path. Then enemy entities are spawn and follow this path, unless you activate the traps to stop them. The game supports multiple players, has a scoreboard and has a reset button to restart the game at any time.

## Getting Started

Install Decentraland with:

```
npm install -d decentraland
```

Clone this repository and then in the project's directory run:

```
dcl start
```

This will open a browser tab with the game.
